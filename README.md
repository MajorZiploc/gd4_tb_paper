# Sticker Moments

## TODO:

### general
- flesh out my theme for ui and start using the variants of elements and less theme overrides. labels especially
- figure out how to run the tweens in parallel rather than using the separate tweens and taking the max timeout to this wait for all of them to finish

### battle_scene

- Add a 'finger' icon and key to QTEItemMetaData only this key type should get the press event
