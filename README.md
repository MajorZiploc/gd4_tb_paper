# Sticker Book: Time Attack

## TODO:

### general

- finish inventory flow - also need to add side tabes like on feature/buff-and-debuff-draw for buffs and debuffs
- update settings page with touch/buttons/both setting for qte
- update settings page with control configuration for controller and keyboard

- track if a run was occurring, then pick up where the player left off

- diff ui flavors for controller vs keyboard and mouse vs mobile - OSHelper.is_mobile() will help here
- Add controller support (and tab support) on ui
- make pause menu accessible for mobile
- add music and sound effects
- update settings page with sliders for music and sound effects

- flesh out my theme for ui
- figure out how to run the tweens in parallel rather than using the separate tweens and taking the max timeout to this wait for all of them to finish

### battle_scene

- Add a 'finger' icon and key to QTEItemMetaData only this key type should get the press event
