# Sticker Book: Time Attack

## TODO:

### general

- finish inventory flow - also need to add side tabes like on feature/buff-and-debuff-draw for buffs and debuffs
- update settings page with touch/buttons/both setting for qte

- track if a run was occurring, then pick up where the player left off

- Add controller support (and tab support) on ui
- make pause menu accessible for mobile

- flesh out my theme for ui
- figure out how to run the tweens in parallel rather than using the separate tweens and taking the max timeout to this wait for all of them to finish

### battle_scene

- Add a 'finger' icon and key to QTEItemMetaData only this key type should get the press event
