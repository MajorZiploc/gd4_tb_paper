# Sticker Book: Time Attack

## TODO:

### general
- move all scenes to ./scenes (rn ./lvls to ./scenes and move . scenes to it) -- .tscn and .gd files
- flesh out my theme for ui
- figure out how to run the tweens in parallel rather than using the separate tweens and taking the max timeout to this wait for all of them to finish

### battle_scene

- Add a 'finger' icon and key to QTEItemMetaData only this key type should get the press event
