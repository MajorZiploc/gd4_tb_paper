## Genre
turn based

rogue lite

2 main scenes:
  - battle_scene
  - maze_scene (auto generated levels)
  - end with a boss (likely going to be a larger char and larger flipbook)

1 vs 1 battles

items and buffs and going to be stickers on the idle page in the flipbook

the flipbook will get more worn down as the char loses health

## TODOs
- Use top spiral flipbooks for chars instead of torn paper
- flip the page to show next keyframe animation
- when char dies, close the flipbook and burn or toss it;
  since the flipbook is closed, the animation for it can be the same for all chars that fit in the same size flipbook
- consider not flipping assets to look at each other. since its a flipbook, if they look the same way, thats proly ok
- for now, dont do flipbooks, just basic stickers is fine
